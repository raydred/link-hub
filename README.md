# Getting Started with Link-Hub

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Purpose

    I wanted a unified landing page for all my social media profile links. I also needed to learn react so why not ~~kill two birds...~~ do both? 

    I sorta modeled the idea from LinkTree (A service I've never used). I'm sure this project will lack a bunch of functionality that LinkTree has, but that's not the point. This project is for me, or for anyone who wants to take what I'm doing and use it as a base for whatever awesome their project will be; do whatever. 

    If you do use this project, it'd be cool if I got a shout-out but it's not required. The license is MIT, so like... take it, or not. Whatever, just don't be weird about it, OK?.
